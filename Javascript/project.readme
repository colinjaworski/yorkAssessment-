[] create function to verify format of UserId (must contain uppercase, a lowercase, a number, and be 8 to 12 chars long)
[X] create variables to hold data. uid is UserID, fname is first name, lname is last name, birthday is birthday and type date
[] write a function called “dateDiff” that accepts one date parameter and returns the number of days between the birthday provided and the current date
[X] Create an “Accept” button to execute your functions
    [] If the UserID does not pass your verification, then print “Invalid UserID”
    [X] If the fname, lname, or birthday fields are empty then print “Invalid fname” etc…
    [X] Print “fname lname you have been breathing for ### days!” where ### is the number returned by your dateDiff() function.  
        Remember to convert milliseconds to days and only return the integer (whole) number of days.
    [X] If the number of days is less than (365*18) then print “You are probably not old enough to take this class!”
    [] Use document.getElementById().innerHtml to display results and information messages.
[X] Create a “Loop For” that loops 20 times and uses code similar to:
    let str = "";
    str = str.padStart(i,”x”); // i is the loop counter
    to print 20 lines of Xs from 1 to 20 Xs.  The first line should have a single X and the 20th line should have 20 Xs.
